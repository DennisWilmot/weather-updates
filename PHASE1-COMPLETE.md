# Phase 1 Complete: Database & Backend Infrastructure

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Database Schema Design
**New Tables Created:**
- `parishes` - 14 Jamaica parishes with coordinates
- `communities` - Neighborhoods/towns within parishes
- `locations` - Specific landmarks, buildings, streets
- `location_status` - Aggregated status for performance
- Enhanced `submissions` table with new fields

**Key Features:**
- 3-tier hierarchical structure (Parish ‚Üí Community ‚Üí Location)
- Backward compatible (keeps old `parish` and `community` text fields)
- JSONB coordinates for mapping
- Foreign key relationships for data integrity
- Performance indexes on key columns

### 2. Seed Data
**Files Created:**
- `schema.sql` - Full database schema with 14 parishes
- `seed-communities.sql` - 60+ major communities across Jamaica

**To Run in Supabase:**
1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run `schema.sql` first
3. Run `seed-communities.sql` second

### 3. API Endpoints Created

#### Parish Endpoints
- `GET /api/parishes` - List all parishes
- `GET /api/parishes/:id` - Parish details with summary stats
- `GET /api/parishes/:id/communities` - Communities in parish

#### Community Endpoints
- `GET /api/communities/:id` - Community details with summary
- `GET /api/communities/:id/locations` - Locations in community

#### Location Endpoints
- `GET /api/locations/:id` - Location details with submission history

#### Search Endpoint
- `GET /api/search?q=query&type=parish|community|location` - Hierarchical search

### 4. Helper Functions
**File:** `lib/location-helpers.ts`

Functions:
- `getParishIdByName()` - Convert parish name to ID
- `getCommunityId()` - Find community by name and parish
- `getOrCreateCommunity()` - Create community if doesn't exist
- `getLocationId()` - Find location by name
- `getOrCreateLocation()` - Create location if doesn't exist
- `migrateSubmissionLocation()` - Migrate old text-based locations to IDs
- `getLocationHierarchy()` - Get full parish ‚Üí community ‚Üí location chain
- `getCommunityHierarchy()` - Get parish ‚Üí community chain

}
```

## üîÑ Next Steps (Phase 2 - UI Components)

1. **Enhanced Submission Form**
   - Parish dropdown (from API)
   - Community dropdown (filtered by parish)
   - Optional location picker (landmarks)
   - Service checkboxes (JPS, Flow, Digicel)
   - Hazard checkboxes (flooding, power lines, etc.)

2. **Interactive Map Component**
   - Show parish boundaries
   - Community markers
   - Location pins
   - Status color coding

3. **Hierarchical Search Interface**
   - Auto-complete search bar
   - Type-ahead suggestions
   - Recent searches
   - Filter by type

4. **Status Dashboard**
   - Parish-level overview
   - Drill-down to communities
   - Location-specific reports
   - Real-time aggregation

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Migration Notes

**Backward Compatibility:**
- Old submissions with text `parish` and `community` fields will still work
- New submissions should use `parishId` and `communityId` UUIDs
- Use `migrateSubmissionLocation()` helper to convert old ‚Üí new

**Migration Strategy:**
1. Run `schema.sql` (adds new tables, keeps old fields)
2. Run `seed-communities.sql` (populates parishes and communities)
3. Existing submissions continue to work
4. New submissions use hierarchical IDs
5. Gradually backfill old submissions with IDs
